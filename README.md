## Design

### Color Scheme
![Coolors Palette](assets/images/345coolors.png)

As the pages of the site have a background image, the color scheme was kept minimal to avoid overwhelming users. Black, white, and shades of grey create a classic and modern aesthetic, ensuring readability and contrast.

- **Primary Colors**: #FFFFFF (white) & #000000 (black) for text.
- **Overlay Color**: #333333 for the site's background image overlay.
- **Highlight Color**: #F1F2F2 for subtle highlights and backgrounds.

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Tinos (imported from Google Fonts)

### Imagery
All images on the website were sourced directly from the restaurant.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. **Navigation Bar** <br>
   ![Navbar photo](assets/images/navbar.png) <br>

   -The website features a fixed and consistent navigation bar across all pages, including the landing form page. Users can access the menu at any time, even after submitting the form, allowing them to continue exploring the site. Additionally, the active page is highlighted in the navigation bar, making it easier for visitors to identify their current location and ensure smooth navigation.

    ![Hamburguer Drop Menu](assets/images/hamdrop.png) <br>
    -Additionally, I created a simple hamburger menu dropdown for screen widths of 968px or less, acknowledging online forums, and tutorials in the credits section. This enhancement improves the website's accessibility on smaller devices and ensures seamless navigation. <br>
