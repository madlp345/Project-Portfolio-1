### Design

#### Color Scheme:

Colour Scheme
As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Black, white, and shades of grey create a classic and modern aesthetic, ensuring readability and contrast.

In my CSS file, I have used variables to declare colours and then used these throughout the file. I was recently introduced to this method during a hackathon—it is a useful convention as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website by changing it once in the variable.

I have used #FFFFFF & #000000 as the primary and secondary colours for the site's text.
I have used #333333 as the overlay over the site's background image.
I have used #F1F2F2 for subtle highlights and backgrounds.
This minimalist palette ensures a professional and cohesive design.

#### Typography:
- **Font Family**: Tinos (imported from Google Fonts)

#### Imagery:
All images on the website were sourced directly from the restaurant.
